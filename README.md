# RestFull-API
Build a RESTful API that can /create/read/update/delete Product and Category data from a persistence database.


To create a RESTful API for managing Product and Category data,
we need to create an API with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on both Product and Category models. 
We'll use Node.js and Express.js to build the API and MongoDB as our persistence database.

1.Install the necessary dependencies.
2.Create a connection to the database.
3.Create the Product and Category models.
4.Create the API endpoints for CRUD operations.
